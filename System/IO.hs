-- $locking
-- Implementations should enforce as far as possible, at least locally to the
-- Haskell process, multiple-reader single-writer locking on files.
-- That is, /there may either be many handles on the same file which manage input, or just one handle on the file which manages output/.  If any
-- open or semi-closed handle is managing a file for output, no new
-- handle can be allocated for that file.  If any open or semi-closed
-- handle is managing a file for input, new handles can only be allocated
-- if they do not manage output.  Whether two files are the same is
-- implementation-dependent, but they should normally be the same if they
-- have the same absolute path name and neither has been renamed, for
-- example.
--
-- /Warning/: the 'readFile' operation holds a semi-closed handle on
-- the file until the entire contents of the file have been consumed.
-- It follows that an attempt to write to a file (using 'writeFile', for
-- example) that was earlier opened by 'readFile' will usually result in
-- failure with 'System.IO.Error.isAlreadyInUseError'.


-- SDM: custom verison of openFile docs removing reference to 'openBinaryFile'

-- | Computation 'openFile' @file mode@ allocates and returns a new, open
-- handle to manage the file @file@.  It manages input if @mode@
-- is 'ReadMode', output if @mode@ is 'WriteMode' or 'AppendMode',
-- and both input and output if mode is 'ReadWriteMode'.
--
-- If the file does not exist and it is opened for output, it should be
-- created as a new file.  If @mode@ is 'WriteMode' and the file
-- already exists, then it should be truncated to zero length.
-- Some operating systems delete empty files, so there is no guarantee
-- that the file will exist following an 'openFile' with @mode@
-- 'WriteMode' unless it is subsequently written to successfully.
-- The handle is positioned at the end of the file if @mode@ is
-- 'AppendMode', and otherwise at the beginning (in which case its
-- internal position is 0).
-- The initial buffer mode is implementation-dependent.
--
-- This operation may fail with:
--
--  * 'isAlreadyInUseError' if the file is already open and cannot be reopened;
--
--  * 'isDoesNotExistError' if the file does not exist; or
--
--  * 'isPermissionError' if the user does not have permission to open the file.

openFile :: FilePath -> IOMode -> IO Handle
openFile = Base.openFile

-- SDM: local version of docs for hWaitForInput, omitting GHC-specific notes.

-- If hWaitForInput finds anything in the Handle's buffer, it
-- immediately returns.  If not, it tries to read from the underlying
-- OS handle. Notice that for buffered Handles connected to terminals
-- this means waiting until a complete line is available.

-- | Computation 'hWaitForInput' @hdl t@
-- waits until input is available on handle @hdl@.
-- It returns 'True' as soon as input is available on @hdl@,
-- or 'False' if no input is available within @t@ milliseconds.  Note that
-- 'hWaitForInput' waits until one or more full /characters/ are available,
-- which means that it needs to do decoding, and hence may fail
-- with a decoding error.
--
-- If @t@ is less than zero, then @hWaitForInput@ waits indefinitely.
--
-- This operation may fail with:
--
--  * 'isEOFError' if the end of file has been reached.
--
--  * a decoding error, if the input begins with an invalid byte sequence
--    in this Handle's encoding.
